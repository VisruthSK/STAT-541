title: Testing Workflow with Renv
---

This is a test of my current GHA workflow to manage dependencies and rendering.

```{r}
#| warning: false
library(dplyr)

mtcars |>
  filter(mpg >= 15) |>
  group_by(cyl) |>
  summarize(mpg_mean = mean(mpg), mpg_sd = sd(mpg))
```

Code is taken from my [pipe post](https://www.visruth.com/blog/pipe/)
